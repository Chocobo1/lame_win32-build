* If you're looking for
  * Fastest x64 binary. You've gone to the wrong place :disappointed_relieved:, you can find faster binary at [Rarewares](http://www.rarewares.org), [AltiVec LAME](http://tmkk.undo.jp/lame/index_e.html)
  * Fastest x86 binary. Well... it's not the fastest but I consider the quality here is pretty decent :relieved:
* Windows executable both x86 & x64 versions included
* Source code unmodified
* When using x86 builds, CPU must support SSE2 instructions
