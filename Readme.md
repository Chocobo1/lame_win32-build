# [LAME](http://lame.sourceforge.net/) Unofficial Builds [![AppVeyor Build](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/Chocobo1/lame_win32-build?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Chocobo1/lame-win32-build)

### Notes
* If you're looking for
  * Fastest x64 binary. You've gone to the wrong place :disappointed_relieved:, you can find faster binary at [Rarewares](http://www.rarewares.org), [AltiVec LAME](http://tmkk.undo.jp/lame/index_e.html)
  * Fastest x86 binary. Well... I consider the quality here is pretty decent :relieved:
* Windows executable both x86 & x64 versions included
* Source code mostly unmodified, with only tiny 1 patch (included)
* When using x86 builds, CPU must support SSE2 instructions
